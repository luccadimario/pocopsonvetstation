Our Team | Pocopson Veterinary Station
Amy_1Amy L. Kidd, VMD
Dr. Amy Kidd has been in small animal private practice since her graduation from the University of Pennsylvania in 1998. She is a native of the greater Philadelphia area, growing up in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania, and attending Muhlenberg College in Allentown prior to veterinary school. While a student at the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Kidd’s interest in critical and emergent care was fostered and is still with her today. A strong proponent of cutting-edge medicine, Dr. Kidd prides herself in her ability to deliver high quality preventive medicine and perform both routine and emergency surgeries. Now, she is excited to be able to provide these services for the patients and their owners at Pocopson Veterinary Station.

Practicing in this immediate area since 2000 has enabled Dr. Kidd to form strong relationships with many of the specialists and referral centers in this region. If intensive or emergency care is needed, these relationships will allow a rapid and smooth referral process. She is also the proud mother of three children: Emilea, Noah, and Nathaniel, as well as countless rescue dogs and cats!
